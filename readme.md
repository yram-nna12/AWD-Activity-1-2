## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Here we have our first Activity focusing on how we design a client's website. We thoroughly experimented on different design aspects to make our elements harmonize.

Guiding Question:
- What is the project?
The project involves designing a website for a client, ensuring that the visual and functional aspects align with their brand identity and business objectives. The focus is on experimenting with different design elements to achieve a harmonious user experience. The purpose of the project is to create a visually appealing, user-friendly, and functional website that effectively represents the client’s brand. It aims to improve user engagement, communicate the client’s values, and support their business goals, such as generating leads, increasing sales, or providing information.

- What are key components?
The key components of the project include the layout, which focuses on structuring and arranging elements to ensure easy navigation and accessibility for users. Design elements such as colors, typography, and graphics are carefully chosen to reflect the client’s brand identity. High-quality content, including text, images, and multimedia, is tailored to engage the target audience effectively. Functionality plays a crucial role, incorporating interactive features like forms, buttons, and calls-to-action (CTAs) to enhance user interaction. Lastly, responsiveness ensures that the website operates seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience.

- What technology used and how it is used?
Programming Languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for coding the structure, styling, and interactivity of the website.
